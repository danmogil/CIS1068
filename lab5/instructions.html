<h1>CIS 1068 Assignment 5<br>practice with static methods and strings</h1>

<p>Due: February 15</p>
<p>70 points</p>


<h2>description</h2>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to gain additional practice with sequences, functions, and testing.</p>


<h2>import starter code and tests</h2>

<p>Please download <a href="https://cis.temple.edu/~jfiore/2022/spring/1068/assignments/05/files/2022A_StringPractice.zip">this</a>
zipped Eclipse project. Import it into Eclipse:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Choose <span class="code">File -&gt; Import -&gt; General -&gt; Existing
	Projects into workspace</span>.</li>
    <li>Click <span class="code">Next</span></li>
    <li>Select archive file. Click the Browse button and navigate to the zip file you've just downloaded.</li>
    <li>Click Finish</li>
   </ul>

<p>Once you've done this, you'll find the project and its included
source file <span class="code">StringPractice.java</span>.</p>

<p>The contents: </p><pre class="code">public class StringPractice {
  /* returns true if c is a punctuation mark or false otherwise

<p>You see that it contains several methods that have not yet been
finished.  Fill in your own implementation. For now, the methods
contain only a placeholder return value so that the code will
compile. You'll replace the lines with the return statements with
returns that are appropriate.</p>

<p>Do not modify any other files in the project. Do not change the
return types, names, or parameters of any of these functions or of the
name of the class itself. There is also no need in this assignment for
any global variables. In short, you will be modifying the body of
each of these functions.</p>

<p>You do not have to write a <span class="code">main()</span> to test
your code. Though it may not be obvious, all of the test code has been
written for you. If you're curious, you can find it by looking at the
file <span class="code">StringPracticeTest.java</span>
included in the same directory as the code you need to complete.

These tests use the popular <a href="http://junit.org/junit5">JUnit</a>
testing framework. For now, you are not required to understand how
they work. If you're curious, by all means look, but please do not
modify the contents of this file.</p>


<p>In order to test your methods using the provided tests, open
the <span class="code">StringPracticeTest.java</span> file, and the
click the run button. Initially, you'll see a red bar, indicating that
not all of the tests have passed. Each of your functions whose tests
did not pass will have an X through its name. Eventually, you'll have
perfectly debugged code, and the bar will turn green.</p>
  

<h2>what to submit</h2>

<p>There are two options: because you're only
modifying <span class="code">StringPractice.java</span>, you may
submit just this, or you can upload a zip of your entire modified
Eclipse project directory. Please send your work through Canvas.</p>

<h2>for computers running older versions of java</h2>

<p>If you're running an old version of Java and you have trouble with
the zipped project file (but <span class="em">only</span> if you're
having
trouble), <a href="https://cis.temple.edu/~jfiore/2022/spring/1068/assignments/05/files/2022A_StringPractice_Java8.zip">here</a>
is an alternate version containing the same code, but is configured to
use older versions of Java and JUnit (Java 8 and JUnit 4).</p>
