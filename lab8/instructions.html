<h1>Array Practice</h1>

<p>due: Monday, March 21</p>
<p>70 points + a possible
   10 extra credit points</p>

<p>The purpose of this exercise is to practice with arrays and static
methods.</p>

<p>Please download <a href="https://cis.temple.edu/~jfiore/2022/spring/1068/assignments/08/ArrayPractice.zip">this</a> zipped
Eclipse project. Just as you did with the String Practice Assignment, import it into Eclipse by choosing File -&gt; Import -&gt; General -&gt; Existing Projects into workspace -&gt; Select archive file.
  Open the project
and its included source
file <span class="code">ArrayPractice.java</span>. You'll find that it
contains several methods that have not yet been finished. For now, the
methods contain only a placeholder return value so that the code will
compile. Fill in your own
implementation.</p>

<p>The <span class="code">uniques()</span>
  method is extra credit.</p>


<p>Just as in the <span class="code">String</span>-practice
assignment, you do not have to write
a <span class="code">main()</span> to test your code. All of the tests
have been written for you using
the <a href="http://junit.org/">JUnit</a> testing framework. For now,
you are not required to understand how the tests work. If you're
curious about the tests, they're in the
file <span class="code">ArrayPracticeTest.java</span>. Please do not
modify the contents of this file.
  


</p><p>As in a previous assignment, in order to run your tests, open the
file that contains the unit tests
(<span class="code">ArrayPracticeTest.java</span>), and click the run
button. Before you've written any of your own code, the methods will
all be broken, the tests will fail, and you'll see output like:</p>

<img src="./instructions_files/tests_failed_eclipse.png" alt="tests failed image" width="50%">

<p>but after your code is completed and working properly, you'll see:</p>

<img src="./instructions_files/tests_passed_eclipse.png" alt="tests failed image" width="50%"><p></p>

<h2>Some assorted notes</h2>

<p> Do not modify any files in the project other
than <span class="code">ArrayPractice.java</span>. Do not use the <span class="code">Arrays</span> class in
your methods. Do not change the return types, names, or parameters of any of these functions or of the name of the class itself. There is also no need in this assignment for any global variables. In short, you will be modifying the body of each of these functions.</p>

<p>When you're finished, upload to canvas either the .java file that includes your implementation of the methods. You may instead zip your entire project folder and upload the zip file to Canvas.</p>
