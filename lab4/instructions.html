<h1>CIS 1068 Assignment 4<br>Grades</h1>

<p>Due: Tuesday, February 8</p>
<p>40 points</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This assignment will provide you with practice using Java variables
and expressions, <span class="code">if/else
statements</span>, <span class="code">Scanner</span> objects for
interactive programming, and writing methods.</p>

<p>Users will provide some information about their performance during the
semester, and the program will output the students' weighted semester
average according to some rules that follow.</p>

<h2>The Program</h2>

<p>You will write a Java class called Grades that must be saved into a
file called <span class="code">Grades.java</span>, which should be submitted through Canvas.</p>

<p>As a reminder, you will be using
a <span class="code">Scanner</span> object for console input, so you
will need to <span class="code">import java.util.Scanner;</span> into
your program.</p>

<p>Your program will read in grades for a student in a fictional
course, and it will calculate the overall course grade for the
student.  Below is one example log of execution of the program (user
input is underlined for the sake of clarity in the log --- you do not
need to duplicate this behavior).</p>

<h3>an example run of the program</h3>

<p>
</p><blockquote class="code">

  <p>This program accepts your homework and two exam scores as input
  and computes your grade in the course.</p>

  <p>Homework weight? <span class="ul">50</span></p>
  <p>Exam 1 weight? <span class="ul">20</span></p>
  <p>Using weights of 50 20 30</p>
  <p>Homework:</p>
  <p>Number of assignments? <span class="ul">10</span></p>
  <p>Average Homework grade? <span class="ul">8.45</span></p>
  <p>Number of late days used? <span class="ul">2</span></p>
  <p>Labs attended? <span class="ul">4</span></p>
  <p>Total points = 100.5 / 140</p>
  <p>Weighted score = 35.89</p>
  <p>Exam 1:</p>
  <p>Score? <span class="ul">81</span></p>
  <p>Curve? <span class="ul">0</span></p>
  <p>Total points = 81 / 100</p>
  <p>Weighted score = 16.2</p>
  <p>Exam 2:</p>
  <p>Score? <span class="ul">95</span></p>
  <p>Curve? <span class="ul">10</span></p>
  <p>Total points = 100 / 100</p>
  <p>Weighted score = 30.0</p>
  <p>Course grade = 82.09</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>

<p>The course grade is a weighted average of three components: a
homework grade, an exam 1 grade, and an exam 2 grade. To compute a
weighted average, the student's point scores for each component are
divided by the total points for that component and multiplied by that
component's weight.</p>

<p>The homework score is determined by the student's average score on
a series of assignments, as well as points for attending
labs. Homeworks are worth 10 points, and each lab is worth 4 points,
and the number of homeworks and labs is the same.  The number of
assignments is entered by the user, as is the student's average
homework score and the number of labs attended, as shown in the
execution log.  If a student hands an assignment in late, he or she
uses "late days."  For this course, if the student uses more late days
than half the number of assignments, the assignment grade should be
reduced by 10%.  If the student uses no late days, the student should
get 5 extra credit points for the homeworks.  However, a student
cannot earn more points than the maximum available for homeworks; a
student that averages 10 points per assignment and never hands any in
late has already earned the maximum number of homework points and will
get no extra credit for being punctual.</p>

<p>Exams are worth 100 points each, and potentially are curved by
adding some <span class="em">curve points</span> to every students' grade.  However,
students cannot earn more than 100 points on an exam.</p>

<p>Your program should be careful to correct bad numeric values
entered by the user.  If a user enters a negative number or zero for
the number of assignments, the student should receive full
credit  for the homework grade.  If a user enters a
negative number for the average homework grade or an exam grade, it
should be treated as a zero.  If a user enters a higher score than
the maximum number of points available for homeworks or an exam, the
score should be capped.</p>

<p>In the log of execution shown, the course has 50% weight for
homework, 20% weight for exam 1, and 30% weight for exam 2. There are
10 homework assignments. The student attended 4 labs (earning 16
points for doing so). The student received an exam 1 score of 81. The
student earned an exam 2 score of 95; the exam was curved by +10
points, but exam scores are capped at 100, so the student was given
100 for exam 2.</p>

<p>The following calculations produce the student's course grade from
the above log of execution:</p>

<p></p><blockquote class="code">
     <p>grade = weightedHomeworkScore + weightedExam1Score + weightedExam2Score</p>
     <p>weightedHomeworkScore = 50 * (8.45 * 10 + 4 * 4) / (10 * 10 + 4 * 10)</p>
     <p>weightedExam1Score = 20 * 81 / 100</p>
     <p>weightedExam2Score = 30 * 100 / 100</p>
   </blockquote>
<p></p>

   <p>Note that the preceding equations are not Java math. In Java, an
     integer expression such as 81/100 would evaluate to 0, but above
     the value intended is 0.81.</p>
   
   <p>When the program asks the user for the weights of the three
   components, it only asks for weights for homework and exam 1. Using
   this information, the program can deduce the weight of exam 2 as
   100 minus the other two weights.</p>

<h2>Stylistic Guidelines</h2>

<p>When handling numeric data, you are expected to choose
appropriately between types int and double.</p>

<p>Please indent your code and use whitespace to make your program
readable. Give meaningful names to variables in your code. Follow
Java's naming and capitalization standards. </p>

<p>Include a comment at the beginning of your program with basic
information and a description of the program.</p>
