<h1>CIS 1068 Assignment 1<br>Greetings</h1>

<p>Due: Tuesday, January 18</p>
<p>20 points</p>

<h2>description</h2>

<p>Your program will consist of a single Java file, which you should
call <span class="code">Greeting.java</span>.  The program should
print a message mentioning your lab instructor by name</p>

<p>For example, your program might print something like</p>
<blockquote class="code">
Good morning, Professor Dumbledore.</blockquote>

(that is, if you're in Professor Dumbledore's lab section this semester.)

<p>Include a comment at the beginning of your program with some basic
information about the assignment, for example:</p>

<blockquote class="code">
  // <span class="em">Your Name</span><br>
  // <span class="em">The Date</span><br>
  // Assignment 1. Greetings<br>
  // <br>
  // <span class="em">Very brief description of what the program does</span><br>
  // <br>
</blockquote>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to make sure that you have the
needed accounts, that you can edit, compile, and run Java
programs, and that you are able to upload your assignment. Though the
official due date is not until Tuesday, January 18, you are
strongly encouraged to  begin
to practice writing short programs as soon as possible.</p>
