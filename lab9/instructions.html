<h1>CIS 1068 Assignment 9<br>Warm Up with Objects</h1>

<p>Due: Tuesday, March 29</p>
<p>70 points</p>
<h2>Cars (35 points)</h2>
<p>Implement a class <span class="code">Car</span>, which contains the fields (5 points):</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="code">make</span>, e.g. Ford, Subaru, Toyota ...</li>
  <li><span class="code">model</span>, e.g., Escape, Outback, Camry ...</li>
  <li><span class="code">year</span></li>
  <li><span class="code">MPG</span> miles per gallon</li>
  <li><span class="code">milesDriven</span>, the total number of miles ever driven in this car.</li>
  <li><span class="code">fuelCapacity</span> in gallons, i.e., the size in gallons of the fuel tank.</li>
  <li><span class="code">fuelRemaining</span>, which represents the amount of fuel remaining in the gas tank.</li>
</ul>

<p>Implement at least the following methods within the <span class="code">Car</span> class (5 points each):</p>
<ul>
  <li>a constructor, which initializes each of the fields</li>
  <li><span class="code">fillTank(double g)</span>, which adds up to <span class="code">g</span> gallons of gas to the fuel tank, but not more than the car's fuel capacity.</li>
  <li><span class="code">drive(double m)</span>, which simulates driving <span class="code">m</span> miles in the car, adding to the total number of miles driven, and reducing the amount of gas in the car according to this car's average <span class="code">MPG</span>.</li>
  <li><span class="code">toString( )</span>, which returns a <span class="code">String</span> representation of the car.
  </li><li><span class="code">getFuelRemaining( )</span>, which returns the amount of fuel left in the tank.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, we should be able to do something like the following:</p>
<pre>    Car oldJunker = new Car("Ford", "Pinto", 1972, 17.5, 132480, 12, 8); // creates a new Car object
    oldJunker.drive(5); // drives the Car 5 miles
    oldJunker.fillTank(1); // put in a gallon of gas
    System.out.println(oldJunker.getFuelRemaining()); // prints the amount of fuel left
    System.out.println(oldJunker); // prints the attributes of the car to the screen
</pre>

<p>Write a short driver program to test your Car class with a short
array of Cars (5 points).</p>

<h2>Fractions (35 points)</h2>

<p>Write a class used to represent fractions.  It should contains
fields for numerator and denominator, and it should be able to perform
some simple arithmetic operations.</p>

<p>The fields (5 points) are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>numerator</li>
  <li>denominator</li>
</ul>

<p>Implement at least the following methods:</p>

<dl>
  <di><dt class="code">public Fraction(int n, int d)</dt>
      <dd>(5 points) Constructor that creates a Fraction with numerator and
      denominator d. If d is 0, throw an ArithmeticException.  We haven't yet had a chance to cover exceptions in as much depth as we soon will, but this can be done simply in your method with the statement <span class="code">throw new ArithmeticException();</span></dd>
  </di>

  <di><dt class="code">public int getNum()</dt>
    <dd>(2.5 points) Returns the value of the numerator field</dd>
  </di>

  <di><dt class="code">public int getDenom()</dt>
    <dd>(2.5 points) Returns the value of the denominator field</dd>
  </di>

  <di><dt class="code">public void setNum(int n)</dt>
    <dd>(2.5 points) Sets the numerator field to the value given in n</dd>
  </di>

  <di><dt class="code">public void setDenom(int d)</dt>
    <dd>(2.5 points) Sets the denominator field to the value given in d.  If d is
    0, throw an ArithmeticException.</dd>
  </di>

  <di><dt class="code">public Fraction add(Fraction a)</dt>
    <dd>(5 points) Returns the fraction that is the sum of the subject of the
    method and a. For example (new Fraction(3,4)).add(new
    Fraction(1,4)) is 16/16 i.e 1/1 We sum the fractions a/b and c/d
    as (a*d+b*c)/b*d then reduce.</dd>
  </di>

  <di><dt class="code">public boolean equals(Fraction a)</dt>
    <dd>(5 points) Returns true if subject of method and argument of call are equal. Fractions a/b and c/d are equal if a*d and b*c are equal or since the fractions are normalized, if a==c and b==d.</dd></di>

  <di><dt class="code">public String toString()</dt>
    <dd>(5 points) Returns a <span class="code">String</span> representation of
    the fraction.  For example, if the numerator is 1 and the
    denominator is 2, the <span class="code">String</span> "1/2" is
    returned.</dd>
  </di>
</dl>

<p>Fractions should be stored in reduced form.  For example, 2/4, 3/6,
4/8, etc. should all be stored as 1/2.  4/10 should be stored as 2/5.
Use
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm">Euclidean
Algorithm</a> for determining the greatest common divisor, so that you
can store fractions in reduced form.</p>


<p>Write a simple main driver method to test your fraction class and
each of its methods (5 points).</p>

<h2>Note about files</h2>

<p>There are several possible ways to organize your files for this assignment. The simplest and recommended way would be that you have four files:</p>
<ol>
   <li><strong><span class="code">Car.java</span></strong> - contains a <span class="code">Car</span> class definition (i.e., what we've been calling a blueprint or a cookie cutter)</li>
   <li><strong><span class="code">CarMain.java</span></strong> - contains your test program</li>
   <li><strong><span class="code">Fraction.java</span></strong> - contains a <span class="code">Fraction</span> class definition</li>
   <li><strong><span class="code">FractionMain.java</span></strong> - contains a test program</li>
</ol>
