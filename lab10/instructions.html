<h1>CIS 1068 Assignment 10<br>Test Papers Assignment</h1>

<p>Due: <span class="strike">Friday, April 8</span> Tuesday, April 12</p>
<p>80 points</p>


<h2>description</h2>

   <p>Design a class hierarchy used to represent test papers that
     would be given in school.  It should include at least the
     following:</p>

<h3>Question</h3>

   <p> Each question has:</p>
   <dl>
     <dt class="code">points</dt>
     <dd>Number of points earned for answering the question correctly.</dd>

     <dt class="code">difficulty</dt>
     <dd>Range of difficulty ranging from the
     constants <span class="code">MIN_DIFFICULTY</span>
     to <span class="code">MAX_DIFFICULTY</span>. </dd>

     <dt class="code">answerSpace</dt>
     <dd>Amount of space that should be left on the paper so that the
     test taker can fill in the answer.  This can be represented as
     the number of lines on the page.</dd>

     <dt class="code">questionText</dt>
     <dd>The text of the question, e.g., "How much wood would a
     woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?"</dd>
   </dl>


   <p>For each question, we should be able to create a String
     representation of the question as it should be presented to the
     student (for example, during a test or quiz).</p>


<h3>ObjectiveQuestion</h3>

   <p>An ObjectiveQuestion is a type of question which has a
   definitive answer.  For example, the question 2+3 has the answer 5.
   (A <strong>non-objective</strong> question would be one where
   there's no single correct answer, e.g., something
   like, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_Talk_(Saturday_Night_Live)#Discussion_topics">"The
   Civil War was neither civil nor a war.  Discuss."</a>.) </p>


   <p>Each ObjectiveQuestion has:</p>

   <dl>
     <dt class="code">points</dt>
     <dd>Number of points earned for answering the question correctly.</dd>

     <dt class="code">difficulty</dt>
     <dd>Range of difficulty ranging from the 
     constants <span class="code">MIN_DIFFICULTY</span>
     to <span class="code">MAX_DIFFICULTY</span>. </dd>

     <dt class="code">answerSpace</dt>
     <dd>Amount of space that should be left on the paper so that the
     test taker can fill in the answer.  This can be represented as
     the number of lines on the page.</dd>

     <dt class="code">questionText</dt>
     <dd>The text of the question, e.g., "How much wood would a
     woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?"</dd>

     <dt class="code">correctAnswer</dt>
     <dd>The correct answer to the question.</dd>
   </dl>

   <p>For each ObjectiveQuestion, we should be able to create a String
     representation of the question as it should be presented to the
     student during a Test.  We should also be able to create a String
     representation of the question which includes the correct answer,
     such as one that a grader might use when grading a paper. </p>

<h3>FillInTheBlankQuestion</h3>

   <p> A fill in the blank question is a kind of question where the
   correct answer fills in a missing word in the provided text.  For
   example. " <span class="code">_____ was the 16th US President.</span>" </p>

   <p>Each FillInTheBlankQuestion has:</p>
   <dl>
     <dt class="code">points</dt>
     <dd>Number of points earned for answering the question correctly.</dd>

     <dt class="code">difficulty</dt>
     <dd>Range of difficulty ranging from the
     constants <span class="code">MIN_DIFFICULTY</span>
     to <span class="code">MAX_DIFFICULTY</span>. </dd>

     <dt class="code">answerSpace</dt>
     <dd>Amount of space that should be left on the paper so that the
     test taker can fill in the answer.  This can be represented as
     the number of lines on the page.</dd>

     <dt class="code">questionText</dt>
     <dd>The text of the question, e.g., "How much wood would a
     woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?"</dd>

     <dt class="code">correctAnswer</dt>
     <dd>The correct answer to the question.</dd>
   </dl>

    <p> For each FillInTheBlankQuestion, we should be able to create a
    String representation of the question as it should be presented to
    the student during a Test.  This should include the blank space.
    We should also be able to create a String representation of the
    question which includes the correct answer, such as one that a
    grader might use when grading a paper. </p>

   <p>In a test representation, this might look something like:</p>
   <blockquote class="code"><p> ______ was the 16th US President.</p>
   </blockquote>

   <p>and in an answer key representation, it might look something like:</p>
   <blockquote class="code"><p> ___Abraham Lincoln___ was the 16th US President.</p>
   </blockquote>

<h3>MultipleChoiceQuestion</h3>

   <p> A MultipleChoiceQuestion is a kind of question in which there
     are multiple possible solutions but only one correct
     solution. </p>

   <p> Each MultipleChoiceQuestion has: </p>
   <dl>
     <dt class="code">points</dt>
     <dd>Number of points earned for answering the question correctly.</dd>
     
     <dt class="code">difficulty</dt>
     <dd>Range of difficulty ranging from the
     constants <span class="code">MIN_DIFFICULTY</span>
     to <span class="code">MAX_DIFFICULTY</span>.</dd>

     <dt class="code">answerSpace</dt>
     <dd>Amount of space that should be left on the paper so that the
     test taker can fill in the answer.  This can be represented as
     the number of lines on the page. MultipleChoiceQuestions can be
     answered in only one line. </dd>
     
     <dt class="code">questionText</dt>
     <dd>The text of the question, e.g., "How much wood would a
     woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?" </dd>

     <dt class="code">possibleAnswers</dt>
     <dd>A list of possible answers, only one of which is correct.</dd>

     <dt class="code">correctAnswer</dt>
     <dd>The correct answer among the possibleAnswers.</dd>
   </dl>


   <p> For each MultipleChoiceQuestion, we should be able to create a
   String representation of the question as it should be presented to
   the student during a Test.  We should also be able to create a
   String representation of the question which includes the correct
   answer, such as one that a grader might use when grading a
   paper.</p>

   <p>In a test representation, this might look something like:</p>

   <blockquote class="code">
     <p>Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?</p>
     <ol>
       <li>Peter Griffin</li>
       <li>Scooby Doo</li>
       <li>Spongebob Squarepants</li>
       <li>Eric Cartman</li>
     </ol>
   </blockquote>

   <p>and in an answer key, could look something like:</p>

   <blockquote class="code">
     <p>Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?</p>
     <ol>
       <li>Peter Griffin</li>
       <li>Scooby Doo</li>
       <li>**** Spongebob Squarepants ****</li>
       <li>Eric Cartman</li>
     </ol>
   </blockquote>

<h3 id="Test">Test</h3>

   <p> Each test has: </p>

   <dl>
     <dt class="code">questions</dt>
     <dd>a list of objective questions of any or all of the types previously
     described.</dd>

     <dt class="code">totalPoints</dt>
     <dd>the sum of the points of each question</dd>
   </dl>


   <p> We should be able to generate a String representation of a Test
   as well as its answer key.</p>

<h3>Driver</h3>

   <p>Write a program that uses your classes in order to generate both
   a test and an answer key, writing each to the screen.
    You're not expected to create an interactive,
   online testing program. You just need to print the test and its
   answer key.</p>

<h3>Extra Credit</h3>
   <h4>Send to a File (+5 points)</h4>
   <p>Add the ability to send a test and its answer key to files whose
   names are determined at run time.</p>

   
<h4>Test Bank (+10 points)</h4>
   <p>Implement a TestBank class, which has:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>a collection of questions </li>

     <li>the ability to generate a Test with a given number of
     questions chosen randomly from the collection of questions. </li>

     <li>The ability to read a collection of questions from and write
     them to files.  Reading questions from files is the most
     difficult part of the TestBank and it will be the source of most
     of the extra credit points. </li>
   </ul>

<h2>What to submit</h2>

<p>Submit  all of your .java
files through Canvas, and if you've completed the extra credit part of
the assignment, please also provide your example input files.</p>
