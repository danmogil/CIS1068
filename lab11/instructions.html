<h1>CIS 1068 Assignment 11<br>Hiring Recommender (Hiring Filter?)</h1>
<p>due Monday, April 25 (hard deadline)</p>
<p>up to 50 extra credit points</p>

<p>Because it's the end of the semester and there's a deadline for
turning in semester grades, absolutely no late submissions can be
accepted for credit.</p>

<h2>description</h2>

<p><a href="https://cis.temple.edu/~jfiore/2022/spring/1068/assignments/11/applicant_data.csv">This file</a> contains information
about a set of job applicants. Your boss has asked you to write a
program to recommend the top 10 applicants
for an entry-level Java programmer.</p>

<p>It's up to you to decide what criteria you use to make the
suggestions, but the criteria would have to be something you can
justify to your boss: you can't simply pick the first 10 names in the file or choose 10 at random.</p>

<p>The file is
in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">csv</a>
format, which is plain text format. You can open files of this type in
Excel, Google Sheets, some other spreadsheet program, or even a text
editor to see what's inside, but any file processing should be done
with your program.</p>

<p>There are no specific implementation requirements, but it's
recommended that you use this assignment as an opportunity to practice
with classes and with <span class="code">ArrayList</span>.</p>

<h2>questions</h2>

<p>Include your answers to these questions as comments at the top of
your Java file.</p>

<ol>
  <li>What criteria did you select? Why?</li>
  <li>What sorts of candidates do we miss when we automate hiring
  decisions in this way?</li>
</ol>

<h2>what to submit</h2>

<p>Submit your java code using Canvas.</p>
