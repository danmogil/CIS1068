<h1>CIS 1068 Assignment 6<br>A Game</h1>

<p>Due: <span class="strike">Friday, February 25</span> Monday, February 28</p>
   50 points 
<h2>a game</h2>

<p>To pass the time during long winters, the ancient Nordic people would play the
  two-player game of <em>Uppf√∂ra</em>.  In this assignment, you'll
  implement the game, but play will be against the computer.</p>

<p>During each round, players choose a move, which may be either Skadis,
Tjusig, Klyket, Hovolm, or Pershult.  The rules are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pershult beats Klyket, Skadis</li>
  <li>Klyket beats Tjusig, Hovolm</li>
  <li>Tjusig beats Pershult, Skadis</li>
  <li>Skadis Beats Hovolm, Klyket</li>
  <li>Hovolm beats Pershult, Tjusig</li>
</ul>

<p>The computer wins in the event of a tie.</p>

<p>Your program should behave as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="strong">[3 points]</span>  The rules should be printed to the screen</li>
  <li><span class="strong">[5 points]</span>  The user is asked if they'd like to play a round
  <ul>
    <li>if they choose 'y', a round is played</li>
    <li>if they choose 'n', the program ends</li>
    <li>Until the user has chosen to quit, another round is played.
  </li></ul></li>
  <li>In a round of play:
    <ul>
      <li><span class="strong">[5 points]</span>  The user is asked to enter a move, which may be either
      Skadis, Tjusig, Klyket, Hovolm, or Pershult.  The program should
      continue to prompt the user until a valid move is entered.</li>
      <li><span class="strong">[4 points]</span>  The computer makes a move at random.  (Hint: remember how
	we generated random numbers in class.)</li>
      <li><span class="strong">[5 points]</span> Determine the winner</li>
      <li>The program prints the computer's move, the user's move, and
      who is the winner of this round.</li>
      <li>The user is asked if they'd like to continue.</li>
    </ul>
  </li><li><span class="strong">[4 points]</span>  When the user has decided to quit the game, the program prints
  the number of:
    <ul>
      <li>rounds played</li>
      <li>times the user won</li>
      <li>times the computer won</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>suggestions</h2>

<p>An important skill in programming is learning how to break up a big
job into smaller tasks.</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="strong">[5 points]</span> Make an outline.  Make sure that your outline makes sense.  Test
  it out with real input using pencil and paper.  Do
  this <em>before</em> you start writing code. Submit your outline as a separate file or within your java file as a comment.</li>

  <li>Turn some of the individual steps of your outline into
  functions.  Some obvious choices might be a function which generates
  the computer's move at random.  Another would be a function which is
  passed two moves and returns whether or not the user has won the round.  The goal should be that
  the functions make your code as readable as your English-language
  outline.  You don't need to implement all of the functions at first.
  Just write placeholders (we call these stubs) first and fill them in later.</li>

  <li>Implement and test your stub functions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also remember to test things as you go.  It's easier to find a
  mistake in 5 lines of code than it is to find a mistake in 500 lines
  of code.</p>

<h2>style</h2>
<ul>
  <li><span class="strong">[5 points]</span>  at least 5 separate functions defined and used</li>
  <li><span class="strong">[5 points]</span>  no global variables. Data is passed to and copied from functions</li>
  <li><span class="strong">[5 points]</span>  input from the user is validated. If the user enters invalid input, he or she should be prompted to re-enter the input until valid input is given. Note that you are not required to handle the problem of the program crashing when a Scanner detects input of the wrong type. </li>
  <li><span class="strong">[4 points]</span>  all input entered is echoed back to the user. For example, when the user has entered a move, you'd write back something like, "Your move is Skadis"</li>
</ul>



<h2>testing (up to 5 extra credit points)</h2>
<p>Remember that good code is readable and testable. In order to
receive full credit for this assignment, you'll need to break up the
problem into at least 5 methods separate from main( ). Develop and
submit JUnit tests for at least one of these.</p>

<p>Recall that to create most of the skeleton of these tests for
yourself, in Eclipse, under the package tab, right-click on your .java
file (CTRL-click on a Mac), select New, then JUnit Test Case. Check off
the functions for which you'd like some starter tests written, and
then click Finish.
</p>

<p>Some functions that we've used that should be helpful are:</p>

<ul>
   <li><span class="code">assertEquals(x, y)</span></li>
   <li><span class="code">assertTrue(x)</span></li>
   <li><span class="code">assertFalse(x)</span></li>
</ul>

<h2>what to submit</h2>

<p>Please upload your .java file to Canvas. If you've completed the
   extra credit, instead zip the entire project directory and upload the zip.</p>
